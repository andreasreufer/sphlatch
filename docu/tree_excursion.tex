\section{A little excursion about octrees}

\subsection{elements of a tree}
a tree is a rooted, directed graph.

\paragraph{node}

\paragraph{root node}

\paragraph{leaf}
node, leaf, subtree, children, parent, octant, forest

(often the term daughter is used for this element, but as trees are asexual we use the neutral term of children)

\subsection{tree walks}

walks as recursive functions:

- postorder
walk children, then do something

- preorder
do something, then walk children

(- inorder:
not used)
